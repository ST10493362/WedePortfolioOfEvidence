# WedePortfolioOfEvidence
This is the third part of my wede poe
Some changes I made include:
Navigation & Structural Fixes
Corrected the previous broken Contact Us navigation link so it correctly redirects to contact.html.
Corrected the previous wrong FAQ page link so it now consistently points to faq_reviews.html.
Ensured the Enquiry page link appears on all pages, not only Home and About Us.
Made sure all pages use the exact same navigation bar for consistency.
Applied consistent active states across navigation so the current page is clearly visible.

User Interface (UI) Improvements
Replaced the banner title and slogan with a full-banner logo, while still retaining the text in the HTML as hidden content for accessibility and SEO.
Updated the Home page product images to match the layout and styling of the Products page, ensuring a consistent user experience across the site.
Applied glowing hover effects to navigation links, using gold and pink brand colors to enhance interaction and styling.
Ensured images, text, and card layouts are clean, visually consistent, and professional.
Added smooth animations and improved visual feedback for user interaction.

Responsive Design Improvements
Implemented responsive typography using clamp() to ensure headings and body text resize correctly on different devices.
Improved layout scaling across desktop, tablet, and mobile views.
Ensured images resize proportionally and maintain proper spacing on smaller screens.
Verified that navigation becomes a responsive stacked layout on smaller displays.
